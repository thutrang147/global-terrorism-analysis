    "### PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
    "This project moves beyond standard descriptive statistics to investigate the **strategic behavior** of global terrorism over nearly five decades (1970-2017). Using the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, we aim to shift the analytical focus from \"What happened?\" to \"Why is it lethal?\" and \"Who is behind the silence?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is structured into two critical investigations: deconstructing the **\"Efficiency Paradox\"** of attack tactics and performing a **\"Ghost Hunt\"** to profile unknown perpetrators using Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n",
    "* **The Efficiency Paradox:** Challenge the assumption that high-frequency attacks are the most dangerous by visualizing the trade-off between **Popularity** (e.g., Bombing) and **Lethality** (e.g., Hijacking).\n",
    "* **Anatomy of Lethality:** Dissect the \"Suicide Multiplier\" effect and map \"Regional Signatures\" to understand how terrain and power dynamics dictate tactical choices.\n",
    "* **\"Ghost Hunting\" (Clustering):** Address the critical data gap where ~50% of attacks are attributed to \"Unknown\" groups. We apply **K-Means Clustering** to profile these invisible actors into 5 distinct operational personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATASET CHARACTERISTICS\n",
    "* **Source:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD) by START Consortium.\n",
    "* **Scope:** 181,691 incidents (1970-2017).\n",
    "* **Key Features:** `AttackType`, `WeaponType`, `Suicide`, `Casualties` (nkill + nwound), `Region`, and `Group Name`.\n",
